  sales: {
    id: "sales",
    name: "Sales & Brokerage",
    tagline: "Front-line deal makers who turn relationships into results.",
    overview: `
Sales & brokerage professionals help people and businesses buy, sell, and lease property. 
You’re the connector between dreams and deals—guiding clients through one of the biggest 
financial and emotional decisions of their lives.`,
    howToGetStarted: `
Most people start as a licensed real estate agent working under a broker. You’ll complete 
a state-approved pre-licensing course, pass the licensing exam, and affiliate with a 
brokerage. From there, you build your client base through networking, open houses, 
referrals, and community involvement.`,
    incomePotential: `
Income can range widely. New agents might earn $35K–$60K while they build their pipeline. 
Experienced full-time agents and brokers can earn $100K+, and top producers can move into 
the mid-six-figure range or higher—especially in commercial or luxury markets. Most income 
is commission-based, so performance and persistence matter.`,
    dayInLife: `
A typical week includes prospecting for new clients, meeting buyers and sellers, touring 
properties, hosting open houses, negotiating offers, coordinating inspections and appraisals, 
and staying in touch with your sphere of influence. There’s a lot of variety, and many 
agents love the freedom compared to a traditional 9–5.`,
    fitForYou: `
This path is a strong fit if you:
• Enjoy talking with people and building relationships  
• Are comfortable with some income variability  
• Like negotiating, solving problems, and staying active  
• Want the flexibility to build your own brand or team over time`,
    prosCons: {
      pros: [
        "High income potential with no fixed ceiling",
        "Flexible schedule and autonomy over your business",
        "Opportunities to specialize (luxury, commercial, resort, etc.)",
        "Clear path from agent to broker/owner"
      ],
      cons: [
        "Income can be inconsistent, especially at the beginning",
        "Requires self-discipline, self-promotion, and resilience",
        "Evenings/weekends often needed for client schedules",
        "You’re essentially running a small business"
      ],
    },
    degreeBenefits: `
A college degree in real estate gives you a major edge over the average agent. You’ll 
understand valuation, finance, market analysis, and investment strategy—not just how to 
fill out forms. That means better advice for clients, faster trust-building, and a 
stronger platform if you want to move into commercial brokerage, development, or 
leadership roles later.`,

  finance: {
    id: "finance",
    name: "Finance & Lending",
    tagline: "The money side of real estate—where deals are made possible.",
    overview: `
Finance and lending professionals help buyers and investors access the capital they need 
to close deals. Mortgage loan officers, underwriters, and credit analysts work with 
numbers, risk, and people to structure smart, compliant loans.`,
    howToGetStarted: `
Most people enter through an entry-level role at a bank, credit union, or mortgage 
company—such as loan officer assistant, junior loan officer, or analyst. Licensing may be 
required (e.g., NMLS for mortgage originators). Strong communication skills plus comfort 
with numbers are essential.`,
    incomePotential: `
Entry-level lending roles often start in the $45K–$65K range with benefits. As you gain 
experience, many roles add bonuses or commission components tied to loan volume or 
portfolio performance. Successful loan officers can earn into the six figures in strong 
markets.`,
    dayInLife: `
A typical week might include meeting with clients to review their financial picture, 
collecting documentation, structuring loan options, working with underwriters and 
processors, and coordinating with real estate agents and title companies to get deals 
closed on time.`,
    fitForYou: `
This path fits if you:
• Like mixing numbers with people-facing work  
• Appreciate structure, checklists, and compliance  
• Are comfortable documenting decisions and following regulations  
• Enjoy being the “problem-solver” who finds a way to get deals done responsibly`,
    prosCons: {
      pros: [
        "Stable career path with clear advancement opportunities",
        "Mix of analytical work and client interaction",
        "Good income potential with bonus/commission upside",
        "Skills transfer well into banking and corporate finance"
      ],
      cons: [
        "Regulations and paperwork can be intense",
        "Market cycles can affect loan volume and bonuses",
        "Deadlines and closing dates can create time pressure",
        "Must stay current on changing products and rules"
      ],
    },
    degreeBenefits: `
A real estate degree with strong finance coursework makes you stand out immediately. 
You’ll speak the language of both the property side and the capital markets side. That 
can fast-track you into higher-level credit, underwriting, or portfolio management roles, 
and make you especially attractive to banks, REITs, and mortgage institutions that value 
analytical depth.`,

  investment: {
    id: "investment",
    name: "Investment & Advisory",
    tagline: "Analyzing deals, managing risk, and growing real estate wealth.",
    overview: `
Investment and advisory professionals evaluate properties, portfolios, and strategies to 
help investors grow and protect their capital. This includes roles like real estate 
analyst, asset manager, acquisitions associate, and development analyst.`,
    howToGetStarted: `
Most people start in analyst roles with investment firms, REITs, private equity funds, 
developers, or corporate real estate teams. You’ll work heavily in Excel, model cash 
flows, and support senior decision-makers on which deals to pursue or how to optimize 
existing assets.`,
    incomePotential: `
Analyst roles often start in the $60K–$80K range, with bonus potential tied to firm 
performance. As you move into acquisitions, asset management, or development leadership, 
compensation can rise into the six figures and beyond, especially when you share in 
promotes or deal profits.`,
    dayInLife: `
Expect a mix of modeling deals in Excel, reviewing leases and financial statements, 
researching markets, touring properties, preparing investment memos, and participating in 
investment committee discussions. It’s more “Wall Street meets Main Street” than a 
traditional sales role.`,
    fitForYou: `
This track is ideal if you:
• Enjoy numbers, strategy, and problem-solving  
• Are comfortable with spreadsheets and data  
• Like the idea of working on larger, more complex assets  
• Want to understand how major investors think about risk and return`,
    prosCons: {
      pros: [
        "High upside in compensation and responsibility over time",
        "Intellectually challenging and analytically rich work",
        "Transferable skills to development, private equity, and corporate roles",
        "You see the big picture of how real estate really creates value"
      ],
      cons: [

        "Not as much day-to-day variety in location as some field roles",
        "Often competitive to enter at top firms"
      ],
    },
    degreeBenefits: `
A real estate degree is a powerful differentiator in investment and advisory careers. 
Courses in finance, valuation, market analysis, and development modeling give you tools 
that many business grads never see. When you can talk cap rates, IRRs, construction risk, 
and lease structures intelligently, you immediately stand out in interviews and on the job.`,

  operations: {
    id: "operations",
    name: "Property Management & Operations",
    tagline: "Keeping properties, people, and performance running smoothly.",
    overview: `
Property and operations professionals are the “COOs” of buildings and portfolios. They 
handle tenants, vendors, budgets, maintenance, and daily decisions that protect income 
and keep occupants happy.`,
    howToGetStarted: `
Many start as assistant property managers, leasing consultants, or tenant coordinators in 
apartment communities, office buildings, industrial parks, or retail centers. From there, 
you can climb into property manager, regional manager, and portfolio roles.`,
    incomePotential: `
Entry-level positions may start around $40K–$55K, with managers often earning $55K–$85K+ 
depending on asset type and market. Regional and portfolio managers can move into the 
six-figure range, especially with performance bonuses.`,
    dayInLife: `
Your days are a mix of tenant communication, coordinating repairs, walking properties, 
reviewing budgets, dealing with vendors, and preparing reports for owners or investors. 
No two days are identical—you’re constantly solving real-world problems.`,
    fitForYou: `
This is a great fit if you:
• Like a mix of people time and hands-on problem-solving  
• Are organized and good at juggling tasks  
• Don’t want to sit at a desk all day  
• Enjoy making properties better and tenants happier`,
    prosCons: {
      pros: [

        "Tangible, real-world impact—you see your work every day",
        "Strong base + bonus potential in many roles",

        "Requires staying calm under pressure and managing many details",
        "Some roles are more operationally intense than analytical"
      ],
    },
    degreeBenefits: `
A real estate degree gives you stronger financial and strategic skills than many property 
managers bring to the table. You’ll understand NOI, cap rates, and how operational 
decisions affect asset value—making you more valuable to owners and investors and better 
positioned to rise into asset management, acquisitions, or ownership.`,

    name: "Valuation, Appraisal & Due Diligence",
    tagline: "The people who answer: What is this property really worth?",
    overview: `
Valuation and appraisal professionals estimate property value for lending, investment, 
taxation, and transactions. Home inspectors, title officers, and due diligence analysts 
also live in this world, focused on accuracy, risk, and compliance.`,
    howToGetStarted: `
Many begin as trainee appraisers, inspection assistants, or title/escrow support staff. 
Appraisal has a defined trainee → licensed → certified path with education, supervised 
hours, and exams. Title and inspection roles often combine on-the-job training with 
specialized courses.`,
    incomePotential: `
Residential appraisers often earn $60K–$100K depending on volume and market. Commercial 
appraisers and high-level due diligence professionals can earn well into six figures. 
Home inspectors typically earn per inspection, with income tied to volume and reputation.`,
    dayInLife: `
Expect a mix of property inspections, market research, comparable sales analysis, report 
writing, and communication with lenders, attorneys, or clients. Accuracy and documentation 
are central—you’re often the “trusted third party” in a transaction.`,
    fitForYou: `
This track fits if you:

• Appreciate fairness and accuracy in numbers  
• Enjoy research and written analysis

training. That makes you more valuable for complex assignments, commercial work, and 
roles that blend valuation with advisory or investment decisions.`,

listing coordination, photography, video, or staging support.`,

Entry-level roles often start around $40K–$55K, with growth into marketing manager, 
brand lead, or creative director roles that can reach $70K–$100K+ depending on company 
size and responsibilities. Freelancers can build strong income with a solid client base.`,
